  Challenge 02: ReactJS Fundamentals
</h3>

## :rocket: About the Challenge

This application is the Front-end for the [Back-end](https://github.com/yagosansz/gostack11-challenge01) developed using Node.js.

The user should be able to add and remove repositories.

### Application's Functionalities

- **`List repositories`**: The application should be able to display a list with all the repositories that have been added.

- **`Add repository`**: The application should be able to add a new repository by clicking the  **Adicionar** (**Add**) button, and display the repository's name upon successfully adding it to the repositories' list.

- **`Remove repository`**: Each item in the list should have a **Remover** (**Remove**) button that will remove the repository from the repository's list.

### Tests Breakdown

- **`should be able to add new repository`**: For this test to pass, the application should allow a repository to be added to the back-end and displayed in the front-end inside a `li` tag.

- **`should be able to remove repository`**: For this test to pass, the application should allow a repository to be removed from both the front-end and back-end.
